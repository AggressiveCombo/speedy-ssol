; Hi! you can add comments to split files using the ; and # symbols
# Like this.
# A split file has 4 sections. The name is defined with a line starting with `>`, like this:
>My cool example route!

# Empty lines are fine, btw

# The rest of the file is broken into three sections.
# Sections start with a line like `splits:` and nothing else on it.

# You name each split. This section is optional
# You can't use a colon character `:` in split names, but other things should be fine.
# You should have  with a list of names like this:

splitNames:
Tutorial - 7
Donut - 22
U-Turn - 44
-> Hallway
Hallway ->
-> Park
Park ->
Final Countdown
End - 100
